This plugin automatically performs several front end optimizations to your site to increase download speed and reduce server load and bandwidth.


== Description ==

Speed up your WordPress site instantly with JCH Optimize! This plugin provides all the front end optimizations you need to optimize your website download speed. These optimizations are applied automatically by the plugin based on how it's configured and reduce both your webpage size and the number of http requests required to download your webpages and results in reduced server load, lower bandwidth requirements, and faster page loading times.


= Major Features =

* Page Cache
* Combine and minify javascript and CSS files
* HTML minification.
* GZip compress the combined files.
* Generate sprite to combine background images.
* Ability to exclude files from combining to resolve conflicts
* Defer/Load combined javascript file asynchronously
* Optimize CSS Delivery to eliminate render blocking
* CDN/Cookie-less Domain support
* Lazy load images

= How to use =

To use, first temporarily deactivate all page caching features and plugins, then use the 'Automatic Settings' (Minimum - Optimum) to configure the plugin. The 'Automatic Settings' are concerned with the combining of the CSS and javascript files, and the management of the combined files, and automatically sets the options in the 'Automatic Settings Groups'. Use the Exclude options to exclude files or plugins that don't work so well when combined with JCH Optimize. You can then try the other optimization features in turn such as Sprite Generator, Add Image Attributes, Lazy Load Images, CDN/Cookieless Domain, Optimize CSS Delivery, etc., based on the optimization needs of your site. Flush all your cache before re-enabling caching features and plugins.

= Advanced Features and Premium Support =

If you need assistance on your website in configuring the plugin to resolve any conflicts or if you need access to more advanced features such as Http/2 support, Remove unused CSS, Lazy-load iframes, Optimize Images, using multiple domains with CDN, then there's a [Pro version](https://www.jch-optimize.net/subscribe/levels.html#wordpress) available on a subscription basis. With an active subsscription you get premium technical support through our ticket system, access to downloads of new versions, and access to our Optimize Image API.

1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to `Settings -> JCH Optimize` and enable the options you want
4. Use the Automatic Settings (Minimum - Optimum) to configure the plugin. This automatically sets the options in the 'Automatic Settings Groups'. You can then try the other manual options to further configure the plugin and optimize your site. Use the Exclude options to exclude files/plugins/images that don't work so well with the plugin.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin speed up your site? =

The plugin modifies the generated HTML of your website in ways that makes it faster to download and parsed by the browser. Simply put, the changes makes the webpage and resources smaller, and reduces the number of http requests the browser has to make to render the page. The result is a better user experience and higher search engine rankings.

= How do I know if it's working? =

After installing and activating the plugin, combining CSS and javascript files are selected by default so it should start working right away. If you look at your web page and it doesn't look any different that's a good sign...maybe. To confirm if it's working, take a look at the HTML page source. You can do that in most browsers by right clicking on the page and selecting that option. You should see the links to your CSS/Js files removed and replaced by the aggregated file URL in the source that looks like this:
`/wp-content/plugins/jch-optimize/assets/wp-content/plugins/gz/63fccd8dc82e3f5da947573d8ded3bd4.css`

= There's no CSS Formatting after enabling the plugin =

The combined files are accessed by the browser via a jscss.php file in the `/wp-content/plugins/jch-optimize/assets/` directory. If you're not seeing any formatting on your page it means that the browser is not accessing this file for some reason. View the source of your page and try to access the JCH generated url to the combined file in your browser. You should see an error message that can guide you in fixing the problem. Generally it's a file permission issue so ensure the file at '/wp-content/plugins/jch-optimize/assets/jscss.php` has the same permission setting as your /index.php file (usually 644) and make sure all the folders in this hierarchy have the same permissions as your htdocs or public_html folder(Usually 644).

= How do I reverse the change JCH Optimize makes to my website? =

Simply deactivate or uninstall the plugin to reverse any changes it has made. The plugin doesn't modify any existing file or code but merely manipulates the HTML before it is sent to the brower. Any apparent persistent change after the plugin is deactivated is due to caching so ensure to flush all your WordPress, third party or browser cache.
